In this project we want to prepare and clean bibliographic data from Transinformação, a Brazilian scientific journal, to support further bibliometric analysis .

We first downloaded the "Bibliometrix-Export-File-2021-11-17.xlsx" from the Web of Science (WoS) database. We requested that the WoS retrieved all the publication
from the journal. This archive contains some informations about the publications, such as article title, authors names, article DOI. The file uses headers
codes that can be found on the following link: "https://images.webofknowledge.com/images/help/WOS/hs_wos_fieldtags.html".

To analyze and correlate the data we will work with a relational database where all the database are linked by the article title.
We then need to create tables correlating the different data with the article title.

The final analysis will be carried out with power BI software to generate interactive dashboards.
