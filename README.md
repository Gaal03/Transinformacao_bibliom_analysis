In this project we want to prepare and clean bibliographic data from Transinformação, a Brazilian scientific journal, to support further bibliometric analysis.

We first downloaded the 'Transinformacao.txt' file from the Web of Science (WoS) database, and then used the Bibliometrix software to generate the "Bibliometrix-Export-File-2021-11-17.xlsx" worksheet. From the WoS database, we requested the download of all the available publications from the journal. This archive contains some informations about the publications, such as article title, authors names, institutions, country, publication year and article DOI. The file uses headers codes that can be found on the following link: "https://images.webofknowledge.com/images/help/WOS/hs_wos_fieldtags.html".

To analyze and correlate the data we will work with a relational database where all the database are linked by the article title.
We then need to create tables correlating the different data with the article title.

The final analysis will be carried out with power BI software to generate interactive dashboards.
